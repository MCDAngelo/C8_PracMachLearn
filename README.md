# C8_PracMachLearn
This is my course project for the Coursera course on Practical Machine Learning, taught by Dr. Jeff Leek from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The goal of this assignment is to build a predictive model to determine how well a particular exercise (Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl) is done based on readings from a number of accelerometers.
